# Next Authorized Task

## Milestone 022 — two-timeframe parameter research

Branch:

`strategy-parameter-research`

M022 protocol:

`docs/milestones/022-two-timeframe-parameter-research.md`

M021 remains independently frozen on:

`prospective-forward-validation`

Do not modify, retune, rebase, or inspect M021 early.

## Objective

Systematically validate the human-selected parameters of the existing **M5 + M1** strategy while preserving its basic entry structure.

Do not add M15/three-timeframe confirmation in M022.

## First required gate — history inventory

Before broad parameter results are inspected, establish the maximum trustworthy common read-only MT5 history available for all five symbols:

- EURUSD
- EURJPY
- GBPUSD
- GBPJPY
- USDJPY

Required market data:

- M1 Bid;
- Ask M1 / sufficient tick-derived Ask data for truthful spread-aware replay;
- M5;
- M15 only where existing exporter/replay compatibility requires it, never as an M022 signal input.

Record exact UTC ranges, row counts, missing-data diagnostics, artifact hashes, broker/source metadata, and runtime versions.

If enough trustworthy history exists, predeclare chronological **development / validation / untouched historical holdout** partitions before optimization outcomes are interpreted.

If history is too short for meaningful separation, stop and document that limitation rather than brute-force the already-inspected sample.

## Phase 1

Implement experiment-only parameter overrides and deterministic reporting, preserving production defaults.

Screen one family at a time using the bounded grid frozen in the M022 milestone document:

- stochastic tuples;
- symmetric oversold/overbought boundaries;
- EMA period;
- decision-time spread threshold;
- ATR SL/TP protection;
- all-hours vs the already-documented 00:00–03:59 UTC exclusion.

Do not brute-force the full Cartesian product.

## Phase 2

Only after Phase 1 evidence is reviewed:

- freeze a shortlist;
- freeze a bounded combination matrix;
- then run combinations.

Do not select solely by maximum historical P/L. Require robustness across symbols, BUY/SELL, calendar buckets, drawdown, trade count, and nearby parameter values.

## Local execution

Use `local-control` and `local-control-results` for Dell/MT5 work.

Installed service:

`chatgpt-mamba2-local-agent.service`

Prefer cloud execution/review for work that does not require the Dell. For Dell-only operations, use existing fixed allowlisted actions or add narrowly scoped fixed actions. Never expose arbitrary shell execution and never expose a real-order action.

Each local result must identify the exact feature SHA and return deterministic evidence.

## Safety / boundaries

Never:

- modify M021 frozen behavior/protocol;
- use post-Sep-25 M021 outcomes to tune M022;
- add M15 as a signal timeframe;
- change production defaults silently;
- merge to main;
- deploy;
- enable/place/modify/close real MT5 trades from research tooling;
- invent commission/slippage/swap costs.

The accepted M019/M020 regression artifacts must remain protected as specified in the M022 milestone.

## Start here

Read the durable handoff docs and the M022 milestone first. Then verify branch/HEAD/worktree assumptions and begin with the history-inventory + experiment-machinery phase.

Do not interpret parameter winners until the data partitions and reporting/selection rules are documented.
